// PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is an open-source server-side scripting language widely used for web development.

// PHP executes on the server side, generating dynamic content for web pages.

// PHP files have the extension ".php".

// To run PHP files locally using XAMPP:
// 1. Place your PHP files in the "htdocs" directory within the XAMPP installation directory.
// 2. Access your PHP files through a web browser using the localhost address (usually http://localhost/ followed by the file path) to see them in action.
// Example: If your PHP file is named "example.php" and placed directly in the "htdocs" directory, you can access it via http://localhost/example.php.

// XAMPP includes Apache, the web server software that interprets and executes PHP code, making it accessible via the localhost address.
